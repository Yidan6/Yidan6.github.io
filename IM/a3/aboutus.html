    <h1>Personal Reflection</h1>
    <p>
        This coffee website has a central idea of providing users with a playful experience and giving them feedback when they click or browse. Firstly, there is a homepage with two buttons in the center: "Shop" and "About Us". Clicking on "Shop" takes the user to the shopping page, where three types of products are presented: coffee beans, gift boxes, and ceramic coffee cups. They are displayed as images, and when the mouse is hovered over each image, a tooltip pops up with two buttons: "Buy Now" and "Add to Cart". Since the "Buy Now" button would typically lead to a checkout page for customers to provide their information and make payment, you haven't designed a specific page for it.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is only one hover effect, where the image changes color when the mouse is placed over it. When the "Add to Cart" button is clicked, the selected product is added to the cart, which is located in the top right corner of the page. The cart icon displays a number indicating the quantity of items added. Initially, you also planned to add a hover effect to the cart, where the previously added items would be displayed in the form of a list when the mouse is placed over it. However, due to technical challenges, such as the information being blocked by the product images, you were unable to implement this feature.
    </p>
    <p>  
        Additionally, you have added background music to the website and sound effects to the buttons. This provides users with feedback as the website responds differently to their interactions. Initially, you had an idea to create a web-based game where users could interact with the website to create their own cup of coffee. However, due to the complexity of using software like Unity for modeling and implementation, you decided to focus primarily on the central interaction of adding products to the cart. As for the animation effect, you have implemented a feature where the products appear to jump into the cart.
        
        Regarding the "About Us" page, clicking on it leads to the current personal reflection section.
