    <h1>Some Reflection</h1>

    <h2>1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h2>
    <p>A:the first thing that would catch my attention would be the visual design and animation of the website, particularly the background with its colourful and intricate fractal patterns. I might also notice the menu and various buttons on the page, such as the "Enter" button or the "Gallery" button, which could guide me towards exploring the website further.</p>

    <h3>2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h3>
